    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Every great story begins with passion, creativity, and a vision to inspire. 
      I believe in the power of visuals to connect people, spark emotions, and leave 
      a mark that lasts beyond the moment. My work reflects dedication to detail, 
      authenticity, and a desire to create something meaningful.

    <h3>My Work</h3>
    <p>
      Creativity is more than an act—it’s a way of seeing the world. 
      Each project I take on is approached with care, ensuring that 
      every frame, word, or design element feels purposeful. 
      My mission is to transform ideas into experiences that speak to the heart.
    </p>
    <div class="box">
      <p>
        Behind every project is a story waiting to be told. I dedicate myself 
        to turning concepts into impactful visuals that capture attention and 
        leave a lasting impression. With a blend of artistry and precision, 
        each piece of work becomes more than content—it becomes a connection.

    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
    <blockquote>
      “Creativity is intelligence having fun. Each idea is a seed—when nurtured with passion, 
      it grows into something extraordinary.”
